        <p>Collected here is a very limited selection from Alderson’s voluminous correspondence, intended to convey something of her writing style and her impressions of life in her adopted country, including both public and personal matters. Indeed, one of the great joys in reading her correspondence lies in the way she moves between the public and the personal. Included here are all of the references from the letters to the work of producing <em>Our Cousins in Ohio</em>. The complete correspondence, from her departure from England in 1842 to her death in 1847, is reprinted with introductions and explanatory notes in Ulin, <em>Writing Home</em>. </p>
        <p>These excerpts are given with no corrections to her often idiosyncratic spelling, grammar and punctuation except for a double space to aid the reader where we might expect a full stop. Lines are broken as in the originals, with significant variation from letter to letter depending on the size of the paper. Words stricken out by Alderson are represented as such. Her insertions are given between diagonal lines \like this/. The two-digit number identifies the letter’s place in <em>Writing Home</em>, where they are lightly edited for readability. The shelf number (beginning with “HT”) identifies the original letter in Correspondence of Mary Howitt (1799–1888), Manuscripts and Special Collections, University of Nottingham. </p>
        <p>The final selections in this appendix reproduce all references from the letters to the sisters’ work on <em>Our Cousins in Ohio</em>.

        <p>Mary Howitt was a highly popular author in her day and a pioneer in literature for children, including poetry, fiction and non-fiction. Although today we might find excessively didactic, her goal was to engage readers with lively stories in language appropriate to their ages. She edited several periodicals and translated the works of Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen and the Swedish Frederika Bremer. Howitt was well read in natural history and travel literature and, in spite of never having left Europe, often incorporated material from around the world in her writing, frequently with an air of exoticism she must have picked up from her reading. The selections here were chosen for their relevance to <em>Our Cousins</em>. They include several poems and excerpts from her <em>Popular History of the United States</em>, her translation of Bremer’s <em>Homes of the New World</em> and <em>The Children’s Year</em>. Other works relating to North America include “The Adopted Warrior,” “Penn and the Indians,” and “A Tale of the American Woods” from <em>The Desolation of Eyam</em> (1827) and “A Tale of the Woods”(an entirely different poem with a similar title) from Ballads and Other Poems (1847).</p>

        <p>As economic pressure mounted at home and transatlantic travel became easier, emigration from England to the United States increased. Publishers and individuals capitalised on this phenomenon with emigrant guidebooks, usually letters or other first-hand accounts from those who had made the move. Not all accounts of emigration were encouraging; nor were they all explicitly aimed at prospective emigrants. Fiction, poetry and personal narrative satisfied the interests of potential emigrants as well as the merely curious. Online excerpts represent a few samples of what both sorts of readers might have been reading in the years leading up to and through the 1840s. See also Howitt’s translation of Frederika Bremer’s Homes of the New World in Appendix 2.

        <p>The following excerpts and newspaper accounts illustrate the complicated and sometimes contradictory attitudes of white northerners toward race and slavery in general and toward the struggle of John Randolph’s former slaves in particular. The racism evident in many, if not all, of these passages will be found offensive by readers today. For more on the subject of race and racism in Ohio and in <em>Our Cousins</em>, see the general introduction to this edition.

        <p>As they have around the world, missionaries in North America played an important role from the earliest days of colonization in the task of subduing and assimilating indigenous people. The education of children in schools on and off the reservations occupied much of the missionaries’ time. Attitudes and methods varied widely among religious groups and over time, but the consistent aim of these schools was ‘uplift’ or ‘socialization’ of people viewed as wild, savage, or, more romantically, childlike. Though perhaps a more humane approach than that of those who favored outright genocide, most missionaries nevertheless sought the suppression of indigenous culture and language and the total assimilation of indigenous people to Anglo-Saxon culture and society. In the words of Richard Henry Pratt, one of the leading advocates for Indian education and the founder of the influential Carlisle Indian School in 1879, the goal was ‘Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.’</p>
        <p>The 1819 Indian Civilization Act of the U.S. government provided for $10,000 annually to support Quakers, Baptists, Methodists, and other denominations in running schools for indigenous children on and off of the reservations. Treaties between tribal authorities and the government generally included annuities to support education, though, like so many treaty provisions, that money was not always forthcoming (DeJong 35). During the 1830s, several acts of Congress forced the removal of thousands of Native Americans from their eastern homes to reservations in the west, opening the way for an expansion of these missionary schools. Quakers had allied themselves unsuccessfully with the Shawnee in Ohio against the U.S. government to prevent their removal to Kansas. In 1837, when they were forced to move, Indiana Yearly Meeting, to which the Aldersons’ own Cincinnati Meeting belonged established the Shawnee Mission School on the new reservation  (Kelsey 142–150, Adkins 81).  This collaboration between religious organizations and the government continued as the foundation for European-sponsored Indian education until the 1870s ushered in the era of government-run boarding schools, principally off of the reservation so as to further separate the children from the culture, language, and influence of their families.
        <p>Although Quaker dealings with Native Americans are often represented as having more respectful of indigenous language, religion, and culture (DeJong 61; Reyhner and Eder 51–2, 62–3) the three accounts included here of Quaker education demonstrate a strong European chauvinism and assimilationist agenda. Paula Palmer makes the case that in the drive to “Christianize and civilize” the original inhabitants of North America, Quakers were distinguished from other denominations, not so much by a greater degree of compassion or respect for indigenous lifeways as by an emphasis on the latter of those two imperatives. While Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, made conversions their primary goal, Quakers believed that native people would fully embrace Christianity only after they had learned to embrace the English language along with English customs, values, and ways of thinking. These were the fruits of Christianity, an appreciation of which would naturally lead indigenous people to seek out and embrace Christianity as their seed (Palmer 297-8). To Quakers like the Aldersons and Mary Howitt, removal of Native Americans from their homes to reservations far out west was not only cruel, but contrary to their aims of total cultural assimilation.</p>

        <span class="title">Appendix 6: Adventure Narratives and <em>Our Cousins in Ohio</em></span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>The adventure story was, at this time, emerging as an important sub-genre of children’s literature. Although <em>Our Cousins in Ohio</em> is more a work of domestic fiction, a narrative of settlement more than of exploration, it participates in important ways in the adventure genre. In <em>The Children’s Year</em>, the older brother reads aloud from Captain Marryat’s <em>Settlers in Canada</em> (1844) and <em>Masterman Ready: or the Wreck of the Pacific</em> (1841) and fantasizes about emigrating to America, “to have all kinds of difficulties and hard work to do, and to be in danger from Indians” (12). As this book’s sequel, <em>Our Cousins</em> offered the promise of just such an adventure. Vicariously, if not in practice, the children of Our Cousins are entirely wrapped in the ethos of adventure. Their fireside reading includes John Charles Frémont’s <em>Narrative of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842</em>; Charles Waterton’s <em>Wanderings in South America</em>; John McClung’s <em>Sketches of Western Adventure, Containing an Account of the Most Interesting Incidents Connected with the Settlement of the West, from 1755 to 1794</em>. Cousin Israel Hopper tells of his journey down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, where he sees alligators and feasts on exotic fruits. From their comfortably settled perspective near Cincinnati, the family are surrounded by movement and adventure: formerly enslaved people moving north, westward migrants in their wagons, displaced Native Americans moving west to new homelands or east to Washington with petitions for redress, soldiers on their way to war in Mexico. It is indeed an “interesting contrast” that Gillian Avery notes between “the first [book] showing the sheltered, cosseted lives led by her own children, and the second…describing the sturdy independence expected of young Americans” (263).
